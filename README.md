#Open Government Plan 2016
##September 2016

- Letter from Chief Information Officer
- NASA and Open Government

NASA is an open government agency based on the founding legislation in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which calls for participation and sharing in the conduct of how we go about the business of expanding the frontiers of knowledge, advancing understanding of the universe, and serving the American public.

From 2010 to date, NASA’s Open Government Initiative has matured, evolved, and adapted to shifting priorities in leadership from the White House, Office of Management and Budget, and NASA executives. The original tenets have not changed; however, the application of open government principles -- participation, transparency, and openness -- are applied according to priorities of agency leadership.

- Cross-cutting Objectives

The first two Open Gov Plans cite the following five cross-cutting objectives, which still apply:
  1. Increase Agency transparency and accountability to external stakeholders,
  2. Enable citizen participation in NASA missions (prizes and challenges, citizen science),                
  3. Improve internal NASA collaboration and innovation,
  4. Encourage partnerships that can create economic opportunity, and
  5. Institutionalize Open Gov philosophies and practices at NASA.

- What’s New

Since the last Open Gov Plan in 2014, we’ve made significant progress enriching and enhancing the foundations laid by previous Plans. Though some of these activities listed in this section are not new, we’ve added new capabilities and capacities to continue this good work, as we move forward into the next two years. Here is a top-level look at projects we love. And by the participant response we’ve seen so far, you love them to.  This is your opportunity to give feedback.

  - Open Innovation Platforms
    - Citizen Science
    - NASA Solve
    - Center of Excellence for Collaborative Excellence
    - Open Data platforms
  - Women in Data Initiatives
  - Federally Funded Scientific Research Data Initiative
  - Code Sharing
  - Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer
- Keeping Track: From Then to Now

We heard from citizens that tracking progress across all the Plans [2010, 2012, 2014 and now 2016] is difficult. To address this, we collected all the activities from in previous Plans. When we publish the plan, these two sections will be organized in a matrix format for easy reference, with an update on progress, and whether or not the activity is complete, closed out, or ongoing. At this point, we’ve listed them with the year we introduced the in our Open Gov Plans.

- Conclusion

We believe NASA will continue to lead federal agencies as we experiment with and create innovative frameworks for citizen participation in our journey to explore the universe of knowledge about our existence in the universe. We understand that not every human will touch space...yet, but in the meantime, we will endeavor to provide opportunities for citizens to engage with us in meaningful ways, and continue to provide access to our research, technology, and data to that it can be used to make their lives better.
Please add the following sections.
What is missing here? Well given NASA's dismal history of using tech to spy on innocent citizens, we will need some checks and balances for surveillance satelites, small sats, and some assurances that they will not be used for "visual hacking". In fact we need an entire section devoted to "citizen cybersecurity", or bringing more transparency to hacker strategies that target innocent citizens. 

What else? Well, we definitely need to highlight the use of open data to counter government propaganda, and in particular black propaganda disseminated via social media. How do the propagandists do it? They stage disasters around the world, then the mainstream media quickly picks up on the "fake news' and spreads it far and wide. They fake documents and science data, and they use it to promote certain technology solutions and to undermine companies that disrupt the status quo. They create fake 'online personas' to harass critics. Let's have a section devoted to bringing more transparency to social media propaganda strategies.

And finally, in the spirit of open contracting, let's see a section on commercializing NASA tech, and in particular, bringing more transparency to the process of funding NASA tech startups and spinoffs, or what I am calling "The Mars Underground" virtual/exponential incubator. This would be a good way to bring in some ideas about how an open private sector could contribute to OpenGov. My job search has begun. This is the area I would like to focus on myself.  Have you been hacked by OpenStack?  Let's hear your story and let's shut down this right wing extremist hacker den ASAP.   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVwtxil69kqw0HI4mfELthtQQpMaiDDNemOU47Dch6U/edit
